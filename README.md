A sample command-line application with an entrypoint in `bin/`, library code
in `lib/`, and example unit test in `test/`.

## ideas

- make a local config json file with token, master token, init for hunter and excluded id 
- [ ] make a command for print in response the user list as : "intId : <@intId>". 
this sould display something like 123455 : @Mezmeraid
- make a command for add/remove hunter from the list
- make a command for add/remove exclude person from the list

## todo 

- deploy somewhere
